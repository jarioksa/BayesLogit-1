Package: BayesLogit
Version: 0.6.1
Date: 2019-07-11
Title: Logistic Regression
Author: Nicholas G. Polson, James G. Scott, and Jesse Windle
Maintainer: Jari Oksanen <jhoksane@gmail.com>
Description: The BayesLogit package does posterior simulation for
 binomial and multinomial logistic regression using the Polya-Gamma
 latent variable technique. This method is fully automatic, exact, and
 fast.  A routine to efficiently sample from the Polya-Gamma class of
 distributions is included.  NB., this package was removed from CRAN
 because it did not pass their QA tests. This version is identical to
 the latest CRAN release except for the fixes to pass CRAN tests. This
 version of the package should be used only while the original package
 is unavailable in CRAN. The fixes have been submitted to the
 BayesLogit github repository, but are not yet accepted. I am a
 reluctant maintainer, but just now there seems to be no choice.
