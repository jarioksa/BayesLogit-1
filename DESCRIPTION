Description: The BayesLogit package does posterior simulation for binomial and
 multinomial logistic regression using the Polya-Gamma latent variable
 technique. This method is fully automatic, exact, and fast.  A routine to
 efficiently sample from the Polya-Gamma class of distributions is included.
 This version is identical to the last CRAN release except that it passes
 CRAN incoming package tests.
